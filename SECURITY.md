# Security and Traceability

UAPF packages MAY be signed and MAY include integrity hashes for auditability.

Recommended:
- `metadata/integrity.yaml` with sha256 checksums of cornerstone artifacts
- Package signing using an organization PKI or signing service

This repository does not mandate a specific signing technology.
