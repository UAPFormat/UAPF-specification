# UAPF Schemas (Normative)

This folder contains the normative machine-readable schemas for UAPF v1.

## Scope
Schemas validate:
- structural correctness
- required fields
- data types and references

Some constraints (e.g., level-specific file presence, executable semantics)
are enforced by validators and tooling, not JSON Schema alone.

Both schema validation and procedural validation are REQUIRED for full conformance.
